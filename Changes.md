* I am on Infinity as a tenant. I create a forecast for a client. It shows on client level, but does not show on the dashboard. It seems the dashboard has some issues. No information is showing there for the user, and I did complete it.
* I logged into a manager on Infinity tenant, it still show information from other tenant, it should only show information from the sales people reporting to that manager in that tenant.







For the client, full year forecast is YTD plus forecasting months, so if there is no forecasts done, the full year forecast should at least be the same as the YTD actual. Just get the naming correct. Always say "YTD Actual", in some place you show "YTD revenue"
